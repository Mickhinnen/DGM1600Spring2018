/*Int- integer: whole numbers. Floats : 1.00001 etc, foats take more data, bigger numbers.
Strings-a string of characters, a rule has to start and end "" (Print is a function that 
prints strings,) string is a data type. Spaces are considered characters. These are variables, types 
of data, String, Int, and Float are a class*/

 /* Variable in english is a thing that can change. I believe it is the same in c#, however 
 we as the scripters are the ones instigating that change in the variables. Today we focused on
 three of them. Int, Float, and String. Int, short for integer is, for math geniouses, a 
 whole number, this stays true in C#. This can be seen in codeing with things such as Foodcounter
 which we were able to change or if left blank is at 0. Float is also a number type data but in
 other numbers in decimal, numbers such as 1.00045, etc. While this can help it takes up more space
 as it uses more characters. I can see this being used in counters like racing games for a 
 speedomoter, or a points system. String is a word variable. Pieces of lingual data strung together.
 We used this with imputing a name on our objects and having it reference, print text for actions
 like on start or onmousedown. And thats about the extent of my understanding.
 
 If statements
 if ("hello" == "hello"){ true runs code} if ("hello" != "hi") true run code
 if ("hello" == "hi") false. Bool true or false statements. == means to compare
 else clause
 if(true statement){ run code} else {run code}* else is a place within if statments 
 + add - sub * times / divide but = assign Value == check equality != check unequality
 >=   >   <=  < 
 
 Scriptable object
